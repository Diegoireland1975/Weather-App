# Weather-App
This is a Weather App using a real API
This is practically one of my first project using API.
Before I made just one project before for the Techdegree using a fake API
The layout it's very simple, you have a search bar where to insert the city.Also when 
you insert e city you will se a photo related to the location, taken from unsplash.com, with the temperature
I used openweather for the API to retrieve the data
